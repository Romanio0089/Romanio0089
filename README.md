I work to preserve the history of computing, with projects such as:
* [The VAIO Library](https://vaiolibrary.com), a website with documentation, drivers and recovery discs, etc, for Sony VAIO computers
* [ArchiveCMS](https://github.com/Vir0z4/ArchiveCMS), a custom-made CMS for archival purposes, designed for the VAIO Library
